🚀 Automating Fee Management with OTP Authentication & Email Notifications (Console-Based)! 📩💻

I recently developed a console-based Fee Management System that automates fee tracking and user notifications, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual follow-ups.

This system:

  ✅ Implements OTP-based authentication for secure admin login 🔑

  ✅ Provides real-time fee status updates for users 📊

  ✅ Sends automated email notifications for pending and completed payments 📩


🔹 How it works: The system runs all four modules simultaneously:

  1️⃣ otp.py – Sends an OTP for secure admin login
  
  2️⃣ feepaid.py – Notifies users who have completed their payments

  3️⃣ feepending.py – Alerts users about pending fees

4️⃣ main.py – Central interface managing all operations

🎥📌 Check out the video demo showcasing how the application works in action!
